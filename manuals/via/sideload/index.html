        <p>Simply put a JSON file <i>("JSON" stands for <b>J</b>ava<b>S</b>cript <b>O</b>bject <b>N</b>otation)</i> is a text file with data pertaining to the application it's targeted towards.  
        For VIA this JSON file has important information that identifies your keyboard through its USB identifier.

        <p>It then also contains a map of keys <i>(so that VIA can draw the layout of your keyboard)</i>.

        <p>VIA then uses this information to recover the "keycode" assigned to each key and also programs your keyboard with other "keycodes" as you change them.

        Why do I need to "sideload" this JSON?
      </button>

        <p>VIA works with a very large list of keyboards - this list is always changing as more keyboards are added to its repertoire.
        Each time VIA starts; it queries this list on the internet and downloads any additions as JSON files.

        <p>But the process of adding the JSON files is guarded against errors with a manual <i>("human")</i> process of "review and accept" by the creators of VIA <i>(known as "The VIA Project")</i>.
        There is no guarantee of time given by The VIA Project, and contributors who submit their keyboard definitions and key-maps as JSON files may need to wait a long time before a The VIA Project member has a chance to review it.

        <p>With this in mind, the creators of VIA allow one to manually add a keyboard definition file into VIA as needed.
        "Sideloading" is just that, the process of loading a keyboard definition JSON file not yet in The VIA Project repertoire, directly into VIA so that you, the user, can map your keys.

<h2><a name="step-1">Step 1</a></h2>

<p>It's assumed that you have installed VIA.  If not, head on over to <a href="https://caniusevia.com"><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> caniusevia.com</a> to download and install it.

<p>The first step is to download the appropriate JSON file for your model of keyboard.  For IDOBAO keyboards these can be found in the <a href="/via"><i class="fas fa-code"></i> VIA pages</a> on this site.

<p>Save this file in a location that you will have easy access to, as you will need to "sideload" each time you use VIA. <i>(VIA was designed to not store anything itself, so the import process is done each time VIA is run.)</i>
