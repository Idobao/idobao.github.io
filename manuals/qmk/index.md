# Using the QMK Configurator

The [QMK Configurator](http://config.qmk.fm) will allow you to build firmware for your keyboard with the latest version of QMK and your own keymapping.

*( <i class="fas fa-exclamation"></i> You should however note that this method removes support for VIA and you will not be able to use VIA to remap your keys.  You can always remap on the configurator though.)*
