# IDOBAO ID67 - VIA Support

<div class="border border-info border-4 bg-info bg-opacity-25 rounded-3 p-3 mb-3">
  <i class="fas fa-info-circle text-info"></i> There are two versions of the ID67 firmware.

  <hr>

  <ul>
    <li>The "<b>v1</b>" firmware is natively supported by The VIA project. There is no need to do anything in VIA, it should just work. This assumes you have the original, RGB Lighting library, version of the firmware installed on the keyboard.</li>
    <li>The "<b>v2</b>" firmware will also work natively in VIA, but selecting the Lighting tab will hang VIA, because that firmware is built on the RGB Matrix library.  To fix this issue, side-load the <b>v2</b> <code>json</code> file provided below.</li>
  </ul>
