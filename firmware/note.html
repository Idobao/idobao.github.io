<h5> <i class="fas fa-info-circle text-info"></i> Note </h5>

<p>There is some confusion around versions.</p>

<p>The trick to understanding is that there are two main components <i>(that have version numbers)</i> of a keyboard:
  <ol>
    <li>The Case</li>
    <li>The <abbr title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</abbr></li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h6>The Case</h6>

<p>The version of the case is the one that is most often referred to.
All the marketing collateral will cite the case version.</p>

<h6>The PCB</h6>

<p>The PCB is where all the electronics and the <abbr title="Micro Control Unit">MCU</abbr> live.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for PCB and Case versions to be misaligned. <i>(This is normal.)</i>
Some times new PCB's are installed in existing cases <i>(e.g., V2 case and V3.1 PCB )</i>, 
and sometimes the same PCB can be in more than one case <i>(e.g., V2 PCB in cases A, and B)</i>.</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle text-danger"></i> <b class="text-danger">WARNING:</b> Always make sure to install the correct <b>PCB</b> version of the firmware.</p>
