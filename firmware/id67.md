## Special Note

When the ID67 firmware was originally written, QMK only had one RGB lighting library, called *"RGB Lighting"* *(See [docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgblight](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgblight))*.  This library has a specific set of animations but cannot do per-key animations.

In 2018 QMK added another RGB lighting library, this one called *"RGB Matrix Lighting"* *(See [docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgb_matrix](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgb_matrix))*.  This library was specifically built for matrix type electronics *(similar to a LED text display)*, but also supported the WS2821 LED *"string"* found in the ID67 *(and many other keyboards)*.  It has many more animations and even per-key lighting modes.

But... the two libraries cannot be compiled at the same time on a single WS2821 LED *"string"*.  It must be one or the other.  And so two *(2)* versions of the ID67 firmware exist.

1.  ***"default_rgb"*** - this is the *(old)* original *"RGB Lighting"* version.  *(This is the version that comes with the board when bought new.)*

2.  ***"rgb"*** - this is the *(new)* *"RGB Matrix Lighting"* version.

**Both firmware will work on all variants of the ID67**, but make sure to see the notes in the [VIA](../via/id67.html) page.
