          "long": "Each keyboard differs.  When you install VIA or Vial you should get a \"LIGHTING\" tab that you can use to change the LED modes of your keyboard. For keyboards with RGB, you can use VIA or Vial to explore your keymap to find the <code>RGB_MOD</code> <i>(this changes the animation mode)</i> & <code>RGB_TOG</code> <i>(this switches the animation on and off)</i> keys on your board. <i>(This is usually on a second or third layer.)</i>  For keyboards with Backlight look for the <code>BL_TOGG</code> <i>(this switches the backlight on or off)</i> key."

          "long": "Many people mistake <i>\"RGB per-key\"</i> to mean that you can change the color of each key - this is not so.  <i>\"RGB per-key\"</i> means that each key has an RGB LED, as apposed to no LED or just a simple white one.  The firmware that we use is the open-source <a href=\"https://qmk.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">QMK firmware</a>, and it features the ability to run over 42 RGB animations.  These you can switch to <i>(or off)</i> using the VIA or Vial \"LIGHTING\" tab.  See: <i>How do I change my keyboards LED's?</i> above."
